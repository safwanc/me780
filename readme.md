Purpose
=======
A collection of various Matlab scripts and files for ME 780: Mobile Autonomous Robotics at the University of Waterloo. Scripts were used to speed up simulations for assignments and the final exam:

1. `sim_template` provides boiler plate code to get started on most simulations. 
2. `get_noise_model` and `get_noise` handle generating random (additive) Gaussian noise.
