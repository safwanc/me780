- ME 597/780: Autonomous Mobile Robotics (Fall 2010)
- University of Waterloo, Ontario Canada

Purpose
-------
A collection of various Matlab scripts and files for ME 780: Autonomous Mobile Robotics at the University of Waterloo. Scripts were used to speed up simulations for assignments and the final exam:

- `sim_template` provides boiler plate code to get started on most simulations. 
- `get_noise_model` and `get_noise` handle generating random (additive) Gaussian noise.
